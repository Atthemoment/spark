/**
 * In sort-based shuffle, incoming records are sorted according to their target partition ids, then
 * written to a single map output file. Reducers fetch contiguous regions of this file in order to
 * read their portion of the map output. In cases where the map output data is too large to fit in
 * memory, sorted subsets of the output can are spilled to disk and those on-disk files are merged
 * to produce the final output file.
 * 基于排序的shuffle,records会根据目标分区id来排序，然后被写到一个单独的文件，Reducers会从这个文件中拉取它的部分。
  * 如果数据太大时，排序好的子集会被溢出到磁盘，这些磁盘文件会被合并成最后的输出文件。
 * Sort-based shuffle has two different write paths for producing its map output files:
 *
 *  - Serialized sorting: used when all three of the following conditions hold:
 *    1. The shuffle dependency specifies no aggregation or output ordering.
  *      suffle依赖不需要聚合和排序
 *    2. The shuffle serializer supports relocation of serialized values (this is currently
 *       supported by KryoSerializer and Spark SQL's custom serializers).
  *      序列化器支持数据的重定位，比例KryoSerializer和spark sql
 *    3. The shuffle produces fewer than 16777216 output partitions.
  *      输出分区数少于16777216
 *  - Deserialized sorting: used to handle all other cases.
 *
 * -----------------------
 * Serialized sorting mode 序列化排序方式
 * -----------------------
 *
 * In the serialized sorting mode, incoming records are serialized as soon as they are passed to the
 * shuffle writer and are buffered in a serialized form during sorting. This write path implements
 * several optimizations:
 *    如下几点优化：
 *  - Its sort operates on serialized binary data rather than Java objects, which reduces memory
 *    consumption and GC overheads. This optimization requires the record serializer to have certain
 *    properties to allow serialized records to be re-ordered without requiring deserialization.
 *    See SPARK-4550, where this optimization was first proposed and implemented, for more details.
 *    序列化的二进制数据，降低了内存使用和GC压力
 *  - It uses a specialized cache-efficient sorter ([[ShuffleExternalSorter]]) that sorts
 *    arrays of compressed record pointers and partition ids. By using only 8 bytes of space per
 *    record in the sorting array, this fits more of the array into cache.
 *    高效的缓存排序
 *  - The spill merging procedure operates on blocks of serialized records that belong to the same
 *    partition and does not need to deserialize records during the merge.
 *    合并时不需要反序列化
 *  - When the spill compression codec supports concatenation of compressed data, the spill merge
 *    simply concatenates the serialized and compressed spill partitions to produce the final output
 *    partition.  This allows efficient data copying methods, like NIO's `transferTo`, to be used
 *    and avoids the need to allocate decompression or copying buffers during the merge.
 *    高效的数据合并方法，避免解压和拷贝缓存
 * For more details on these optimizations, see SPARK-7081.
